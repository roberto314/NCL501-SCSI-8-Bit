# NCL501-SCSI-8-Bit
Recreation of a bootable ISA 8-Bit SCSI Card.

![](pics/NCL%20501.jpg)

There is one PAL on the Card (PAL16L8), it is protected unfortunately.
A dump has been done and the equations have been recreated.
They might be wrong.
BIOS EPROM is a 27C64 Type, RAM is not poplated but a 6116 might be used (24-pin Socket).
Schematic is in: schematic/NCL501/pdf/NCL501.pdf.
